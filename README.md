# Text-Classifier
Text Classification with NLP using Word2Vec.
Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used for natural language processing and text classification. It is a neural network-based approach that learns distributed representations (also called embeddings) of words from a large corpus of text. These embeddings capture the semantic and syntactic relationships between terms, which can be used to improve text classification accuracy.
